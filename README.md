## Rules for PHP Variables

1. A variable starts with the `$` sign, followed by the name of the variable.
2. A variable name must start with:
   - A letter, or
   - The underscore (`_`) character.
3. A variable name **cannot** start with a number.
4. A variable name can only contain:
   - Alpha-numeric characters (`A-z`, `0-9`), and
   - Underscores (`_`).
5. Variable names are **case-sensitive**:
   - `$age` and `$AGE` are considered two different variables.
